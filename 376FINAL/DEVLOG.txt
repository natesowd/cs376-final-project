Set the general idea of the project. 
We want to build a 3D game where the player tries to dodge enemies spawning from a 2D wall.
Once the enemy spawns, it will go directly to the front, trying to bump into the player.

Player Behavior:
Moves around the X-axis and Y-axis. Shoots bullet along the positive Z-axis. 
The player has a health bar of 10 health.

Bullet Behavior:
Occurs in front of the player every time when the fire button is pressed.

Enemy Behavior:
The enemy ambushes towards us along the negative Z-axis. 
When the player's bullet touches enemy, the enemy dies.
When the enemy goes beyond 

Aesthetic Goals
1. Challenge 
- Our game provides player with the challenge to get a better score and maitain a longer play time.
- Sign of success: The player woud want to get better at the score 
- Sign of failure: The player has no motive to keep trying

2. Fantasy
- Our game imitates how spaceship moves and provides players with the fantasy of space fights.
- Sign of success: The player views it as a simplified version of space fight.
- Sign of failure: The player fails to imagine themselves as a spaceship commander or themselves in a space fight.

Core Mechanics:
The player would spend most of their time in moving around dodging the enemies while shoot to kill the most enemies.

Core Loop:
Spot enemy - Shoot to the enemy - if shooting succeed, stay - if shooting fails, move to dodge
